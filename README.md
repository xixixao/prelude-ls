# prelude.coffee
is a JavaScript functional programming library. It is written for and in, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. It is a fork of prelude.ls, LiveScript's excellent recommended base library, which is based in part off of Haskell's Prelude module.

See **[the prelude.coffee site](http://xixixao.github.com/prelude-ls/)** for examples, a reference, and more.

You can install prelude.coffee by cloning this repo into node-modules or by copying the precompiled JS files. See the site for more info.
